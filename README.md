## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an advanced, self-healing cyber immune network that autonomously detects and responds to malware threats. Combining deep neural networks (DNN), ensemble models, federated learning, adversarial (GAN-based) training, and explainable AI (XAI), the system achieves:

- **99.1% malware detection accuracy** (CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset)
- Real-time interactive monitoring and simulation (Streamlit dashboard)
- SHAP-based explainability for transparency in AI decisions
- Automated research documentation

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Deep Learning & Ensemble Models:** Robust multi-model threat detection
- **Federated Learning:** Distributed training for privacy and scalability
- **Adversarial Training:** GAN-generated synthetic attacks for model hardening
- **Explainable AI:** SHAP/feature importance integrated into reports & dashboard
- **Automated reporting:** Generates research paper & explainability outputs
- **Cloud Deployment:** Hosted on Streamlit Cloud for instant public access
